Enna is a theme for [Grav](http://getgrav.com/) that I put together for my personal website.

It is responsive and the layouts are fluid. Mobile support still needs work, however.

Based, in part, on the [Antimatter](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-theme-antimatter) Grav theme, it uses [normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css) as a reset, and [FlowType.JS](https://github.com/simplefocus/FlowType.JS) for better font control.

It is currently incomplete. Modular page support is lacking and more effort needs to be put into cleaning up the templates and scss.

## Demo

A variation of this theme can be seen at [ryan.abel.space](http://ryan.abel.space).
